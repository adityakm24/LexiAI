### **Project Title**: **AI-Powered Legal Document Generator and Validator**

### **Description**:
This project focuses on building an AI-based pipeline to generate, validate, and analyze synthetic legal documents, catering to diverse jurisdictions and legal requirements. Using state-of-the-art NLP models like GPT, the pipeline automates the creation of privacy policies, terms of service, and employment contracts while ensuring high-quality, unbiased, and semantically aligned data. 

Key features include:
1. **Dynamic Document Generation**: Generate legal documents based on user inputs and jurisdictional requirements.
2. **Validation Tools**: Evaluate documents for structural completeness, lexical diversity, and bias.
3. **NLP Pipeline**: Handle tasks like summarization, query answering, and legal clause extraction.

This project aims to streamline legal document creation while maintaining compliance and diversity, ultimately serving as a foundation for fine-tuned legal AI systems.
